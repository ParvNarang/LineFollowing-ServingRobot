# ROBOWAITER
This robot was made to serve people in a restraunt/hospital by delivering food items/medicines to the people.
The robot has a control-room where the robot is parked and sent to various locations on the floor, making use of an IR-sensor array that follows a black line.
The robot receives the input in the form of an integer from the touch sensor and goes to the location on the floor by checking its status. This status is checked with the help of junctions present on the floor. It then reaches the table/bed and waits for the person to take the food and returns to the control-room.
